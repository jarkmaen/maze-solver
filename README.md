## Command line operations

To run the following commands below, you'll need to have both [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed on your computer. Run all commands from the root directory of the project (the folder containing the pom.xml file).

### Running the application

To run the application, use the command:

```
mvn compile exec:java
```

### Building the .jar file

To create an executable .jar file, use the command:

```
mvn package
```

This will generate the file mazesolver-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in the target/ directory.

### Testing

To run unit tests, use the command:

```
mvn test
```

To generate a test coverage report, use the command:

```
mvn jacoco:report
```

The output can be found in the target/site/jacoco/ directory under the name index.html.

### JavaDoc

To generate JavaDoc documentation, use the command:

```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

The output can be found in the target/reports/apidocs/ directory under the name index.html.

### Checkstyle

To perform a Checkstyle check, use the command:

```
mvn jxr:jxr checkstyle:checkstyle
```

The output can be found in the target/site/ directory under the name checkstyle.html.
